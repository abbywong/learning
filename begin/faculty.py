"""
Now you can learn to make a function. Here's an example:
"""

def square(x):
	return x*x

print('squares:')
print(square(4))
print(square(11))

"""
You added a new command to the language!

Your function will be more difficult: you should calculate the faculty of a number:

1! = 1
2! = 2 * 1 = 2
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
...
8! = 8 * 7! = 40320

Please change the function below to be correct:
"""

def faculty(number):
	return number

print('faculty:')
print(faculty(4))
print(faculty(6))
print(faculty(9))
